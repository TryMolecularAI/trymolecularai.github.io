MolecularAI is developing [AI-powered software] (https://trymolecularai.com/) that identifies unknown chemical compounds from mass spectrometry data, specifically from compound fragmentation spectra. 

How it works
======
Step 1:
Upload Your Mass Spectra
Start by uploading your raw mass spectrometry data files. Our platform supports a wide range of formats commonly used in mass spectrometry.

Step 2: AI-Driven Compound Identification
Review the identified compounds and their associated confidence scores.

Step 3:Access and Export Results
Review the identified compounds and their associated confidence scores.
